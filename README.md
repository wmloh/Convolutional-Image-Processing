# Convolutional Image Processing

High level abstraction of the Python Imaging Library (PIL) that enables filters and generic image processing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contains two class: StdImg and ConvImg

Motivation:
This project was done to gain experience and exposure in deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNN requires understanding
in mathematical convolutional operations. While this project does not include any deep learning capabilities, it does provide
hands-on experience with image processing which may be needed in many machine learning investigations.
